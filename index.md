* Lab 1

   I liked this lab because it taught me alot about how to structure my program. Although it now seems so simple to understand and recreate it is still fun to see how far I've come. Overall this lab was an easy intro to the world of coding and understanding the essential.

* Lab 7

  Lab 7, part 2 fascinated me with its exploration of Blackjack mechanics. Writing functions for the first time, especially those calculating hand values with multiple Aces, proved both challenging and rewarding. It deepened my understanding of the game's complexities.
 
* Lab 5

   Being able to create a calculator with just a program was crazy to me. I didn't think I would be able to do that. It was cool that I could make something that can help anyone really. This lab taught me about implementing the right information inorder to receive the right answer.
