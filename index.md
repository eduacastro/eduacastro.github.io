## Labs/Programs in cspc 120

* Lab 1

   I liked this lab because it tought me alot about hot to structure my program. Although it nows seems so simple to understand and recreate it still fun to see how far I've come. Overall this lab was an easy intro to the the world of coding.

* Lab 3
  Again the reason for why we did this lab taught me alot which is why I like this lab. Being able to input data and haveing a resulting table was really cool. This lab was probably my favorite for that reason

* Lab 5
  Being able to create a calculator with just a program was crazy to me. I didn't think I would be able to do that. It was cool that I could make something that can help anyone really
